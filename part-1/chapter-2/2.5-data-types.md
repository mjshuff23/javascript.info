# **Data Types**

- A value in JS is always of a certain type. Like a string or a number
- There are eight basic data types in JS.
- We can put any type in a variable, and change it's type with reassignment
  ```javascript
  let message = 'hey'; // String
  message = 22; // Number now
  ```
  - Programming languages that allow this are called _dynamically typed_, meaning there are data types, but variables are not bound to them

## **Number**

```javascript
let num = 123;
num = 12.345;
```

- Represents both **integers** and **floating point** numbers
- Many operations are available for numbers, such at _addition_ `+`, _subtraction_ `-`, _multiplication_ `*`, _division_ `/`, _modulo (remainder)_ `%`, etc...
- Besides regular numbers, there are so-called "special numeric values" which also belong to this data type:
  - `Infinity` - Represents mathematical Infinity âˆž
    - Is a special value that's greater than any number
  - `-Infinity`
  - `NaN (Not a Number)`
