# **Math Operations [Code](./2.8-math-operations.js)**

## **Unary, Binary, Operand**

- **Operand** - What _operators_ are applied to. For instance, in the multiplication of `5 * 2`, there are two operands: `5` is the left operand and `2` is the right operand. These are sometimes called _arguments_ as well.
- **Unary** - A _unary operator_ takes a single _operand_

  - _unary negation_ `-` reverses the sign of a number
  - _unary addition_ `+` converts operand to a number

  ```javascript
  let x = 1;
  x = -x;
  console.log(x); // -1

  let str = '123';
  let num = +str;
  console.log(typeof num); // "number"
  ```

- **Binary** - An operator that has _two operands_:

```javascript
let x = 1
let y = 10;
let sum = x + y; // binary additions
let difference y - x // binary minus substracts
```

## **Math Operations**

- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Multiplication `*`
- Division `/`
- Modulo(Remainder) `%` - The remainder of integer division
- Exponentiation `**` - raises left operand to the power of right operand

  ```javascript
  console.log(10 ** 2); // 100

  // square root is exponentiation by 1/2
  console.log(100 ** (1 / 2)); // 10

  // cubic root is exponentiation by 1/3
  console.log(8 ** (1 / 3)); // 2
  ```

## **String Concatenation With Binary `+`**

- When the `+` operator is applied to string, it merges (concatenates) them together
  ```javascript
  let firstName = 'Michael';
  let lastName = 'Shuff';
  console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName); // "Michael Shuff"
  ```
- If any operand is a string, the other operands will be converted to a string as well
  ```javascript
  console.log(1 + '2'); // '12'
  ```
- The operators work one after another, which means addition may happen before concatenation depending on the order:
  ```javascript
  console.log(5 + 5 + '1'); // 101
  ```
- The binary `+` is the only operator that works this way with strings, other operators attempt to convert data types to numbers
