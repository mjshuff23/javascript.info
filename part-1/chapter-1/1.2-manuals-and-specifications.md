# Manuals and Specifications

## **Specification**

<base target="_blank"/>

- The <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm" target="_blank">**ECMA-262 Specification**</a> contains the most in-depth, detailed, and formalized information about JS. This defines the language
  - Being that it's formalized, it's difficult to understand. This is the most trustworthy source of information, but it's not for everyday use.
  - A new specification is released every year. In-between these releases, there will be a <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/" target="_blank">Specification Draft</a>
  - You can also go to the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals" target="_blank">Proposals Page</a> to see new bleeding-edge features that are almost standard ("stage 3 proposals")

## **Manuals**

- <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference" target="_blank">MDN (Mozilla) JavaScript Reference</a> is the main manual with examples and other information. Great for in-depth information about individual language functions, methods, etc...
  - It is often best to use an internet search like <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> instead, and search for _"MDN [term]"_

## **Compatibility Tools**

- JavaScript is a developing language, and new features are added regularly. To see their support among browser-based and other engines, see:
  - <a href="http://caniuse.com/" target="_blank">http://caniuse.com/</a> - Per-feature tables of support
  - <a href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table" target="_blank">https://kangax.github.io/compat-table</a> - A table with language features and engines that support or don't support those
- These resources are useful in real-life development, as they contain valuable information about language details and their support
