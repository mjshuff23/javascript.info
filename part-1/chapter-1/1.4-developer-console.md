# Developer Console and Tools

- Code is prone to errors. In the browser, users don't see the errors by default.
- To see errors and get a lot of other useful information about scripts, **"developer tools"** have been embedded into browsers
- Most developers lean toward _Chrome_ and _Firefox_ for development because these browsers have the best developer tools. Other browsers also have developer tools and special features, but tend to be playing catch-up with Chrome and Firefox
  - Developers tend to pick a "favorite" browser, and then check the others to make sure their site runs well on other browsers

## **Google Chrome**

- Open with `F12`, or if you're on Mac, `Cmd+Opt+J` to open the developer tools
- Will open on the _Console Tab_ by default
  - Errors will be colored <span style="color: red; background-color: pink; font-weight: bold; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px">red</span> and will contain a clickable link to the source where the error occured along with the line number it occured on
